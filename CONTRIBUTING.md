## CONTRIBUTE TO LEARN-ES6

###### As said earlier, this project is a work in progress and all contributions are very much welcome. You just have to make sure you have great comments in the code  and they should clearly state what the code is about. You can submit codes that fixes bugs, practice codes that does something in particular and can be of didactic help, You can submit codes on a new lesson -- let the code be very well documented showing use cases and put the code in the docs folder.


###### Also, you must adhere to correct syntax

###### Your code should be debugged and tested.

###### great comments and documentations would be very much appreciated.

###### You can submit functional codes that you have worked on and can serve as a learning tool to others. --- place such a code in a new directory called 'practice', "more", "advanced  - if you feel like the code is advanced enough".

###### es6 codes that are meant for tutorials and bug free should be placed in the es6 folder. the es5 folder is for transpiled codes. so your es6 code will definitely be transpiled there.

#### thank you in advance.
